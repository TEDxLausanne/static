                <h2>The format of your video:</h2>

                <h4>How long does my video need to be?</h4>

                <p>Give us an impression of you and your idea in three minutes or less.</p>

                <br/>
                <h4>What format does my video need to be?</h4>

                <p>It doesn’t matter as long as you can upload it to youtube or vimeo. You can do it privately and simply submit the link.</p>

                <br/>
                <h4>What language?</h4>

                <p>The event will be held in English so please submit a video in English.</p>

                <br/>
                <h4>What style should my video be?</h4>

                <p>We are giving you creative license to use your own style, however, remember whatever your style is, it should tell a compelling story of your idea worth spreading related to “Inter:face Inter:act”.</p>

                <br/>
                <h4>Can I use music/photos/animation in my video?</h4>

                <p>Sure, if it helps, use it! BUT do ensure that we can hear you too!</p>

                <hr>

                <h2>I have submitted my video, now what?</h2>

                <br/>
                <h4>Will I become famous by making this video?</h4>

                <p>We wish it were that easy! This video will NOT be published, publicized or propagated by us.</p>

                <br/>
                <h4>Who owns the content of the video?</h4>

                <p>The video and its content belongs solely to you, the person who made it. TEDxLausanne is not responsible for the content.</p>

                <p>If you want the video private, upload with settings where only those with the link can see the video.</p>

                <p>The video will be viewed exclusively by members of the TEDxLausanne 2015 organizing committee and speaker selection team.</p>

                <br/>
                <h4>What happens if I am selected?</h4>

                <p>Congrats!!! A member of our team will be in touch with you to help guide you in preparation of your talk.</p>

                <p>Please be aware that a certain time commitment and investment is required on your part to prepare your final talk so it is up to the high standards of a TEDxLausanne event. Expect to meet with us in person to prepare and rehearse your talk. Even the best speakers need to practice to give an excellent talk!</p>

                <br/>
                <h4>What are the criteria on which my video will be evaluated?</h4>

                <p>We assess the videos based on the uniqueness, quality, and depth of the ideas presented, the presence of the speaker, and the relevance to our theme.</p>

                <p>Again, the quality of the video is less important than the content at this stage!!</p>
